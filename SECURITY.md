## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities using a public GitHub issue. If you believe you've found a security issue, please contact our security mailing list.

security@saleor.io

At this time we do not have a bounty program in place so we are not able to offer monetary rewards for any problems reported.

You can also claim bounty rewards by reporting vulnerabilities using Huntr: https://huntr.dev

Whichever method you choose, you will be credited as the reporter once the announcement is published.
